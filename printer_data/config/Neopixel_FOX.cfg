# Macros for setting the status leds on the Voron StealthBurner toolhead (or for any neopixel-type leds).
#
# You will need to configure a neopixel (or other addressable led, such as dotstar). See
# https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#neopixel for configuration details.
#
# CONFIGURATION
[neopixel BED_LED]
pin: PD3
#   The pin connected to the neopixel. This parameter must be
#   provided.
chain_count: 10
#   The number of Neopixel chips that are "daisy chained" to the
#   provided pin. The default is 1 (which indicates only a single
#   Neopixel is connected to the pin).
color_order: GRB
#   Set the pixel order required by the LED hardware (using a string
#   containing the letters R, G, B, W with W optional). Alternatively,
#   this may be a comma separated list of pixel orders - one for each
#   LED in the chain. The default is GRB.
initial_RED: 0.0
initial_GREEN: 0.0
